<p>Postavka pristranost nadzoruje ali bodo podatki simulirali razlike med skupinami v <strong>faktorskih utežeh</strong> (Metric) ali <strong>Presečiščih</strong> (Scalar).</p>
<p><strong>MC</strong> = Primerjava med Metričnim in Konfiguralnim modelom (Metrična invariantnost)</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cfi-1-in-rmsea-0">CFI = 1 in RMSEA = 0</h3>
<p>opazil sem, da so razlike med indeksi prileganja npr. CFI 0. Ko sem pogledal podatke sem opazil, da imajo nekateri modeli CFI =1 in RMSEA = 0, kar predstavlja popolno prileganje. Glede na to, da ima model več kot 0 prostostnih stopenj in ni natanko identificiran je vprašanje ali so take vrednosti normalne?</p>
<p>Pojavljajo se tako za osnovni (CFI_1, RMSEA_1), Metrični (CFI_2, RMSEA_2) in Skalarni (CFI_3, RMSEA_3) model.</p>

<p>Raziskave so pokazale<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> razlike med indeksi, ko uporabljamo maximum likelihood (ML) in diagonally weighted least squares (DWLS)<span class="citation" data-cites="shi2020 xia2019">(<a href="#ref-shi2020" role="doc-biblioref">Shi &amp; Maydeu-Olivares, 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-xia2019" role="doc-biblioref">Xia &amp; Yang, 2019</a>)</span>. Opozarjajo na to, da uporaba mejnih vrednosti za ML metode na indeksih pridobljenih z DWLS lahko vodi do napak. Sicer gledam razlike med indeksi in ne vrednosti indeksov samih, vendar me vseno zanima ali bi to bilo pomembno omeniti?</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>The results showed that DWLS and ULS lead to smaller RMSEA and larger CFI and TLI values than does ML for all manipulated conditions, regardless of whether or not the indices are scaled. Applying the conventional cutoffs to DWLS and ULS, therefore, has a pronounced tendency not to discover model–data misfit. (Xia in Yang, 2019)<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>In contrast, MML, DWLS, and ULS have been shown to provide similar results and work well at more modest sample sizes of about 500, especially with indicators that are not highly skewed. They all provide accurate estimates of the factor loadings, and goodness-of-fit statistics with proper Type 1 error rates and sufficient statistical power(Liu idr., 2017)<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
